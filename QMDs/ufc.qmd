This dataset contains information on UFC fights that had a champion participating. This dataset is 4 years old so what I would like to do is create a model, perhaps a simple one, that will be used to predict championship title matches that have happened since and upcoming bouts. To challenge myself further I wil try to make useful vizualizations and will be using python to throughout this project including using new packages such as matplotlib, seaborn and plotly (I have minimial experience with pandas).

First lets load in these packages and our [UFC dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akouaorsot/ufc-champions-fights/data) from kaggle

```{python}
import os
import pandas as pd
base_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath("__file__"))
data_path = os.path.join(base_dir, "..", "data", "ufc_champs_final.csv")
ufc = pd.read_csv(data_path)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly.express as px
print(ufc.head())
```

As we can see there are a 121 variables so we will try to narrow that down, but first lets do some exploratory data analysis.

```{python}
sns.set_theme(style = "whitegrid")
plt.figure(figsize = (8, 5))
sns.countplot(data = ufc, x = "title_bout", palette = "viridis")
plt.title("title vs non-title fights")
plt.xlabel("distribution of title vs non-title fights")
plt.ylabel("number of fights")
plt.show()
```

```{python}
#champ_counts = ufc.query("") filter
#champ_counts = ufc["R_fighter"].value_counts()
#champ_counts_b = ufc["B_fighter"].value_counts()
#print(champ_counts, champ_counts_b)
#set_a = set(ufc["R_fighter"])
#set_b = set(ufc["B_fighter"])
#total_fights = set_a.intersection(set_b)
#print(total_fights)
```
