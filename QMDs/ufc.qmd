reading and printing out the first 6 rows of the dataset

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly as px
print("Hello World")
ufc = pd.read_csv(r"data\ufc_champs_final.csv")
print(ufc.head())
```

As we can see there are a 121 variables so we will try to narrow that down, but first lets do some exploratory data analysis.

```{python}
sns.set_theme(style = "whitegrid")
plt.figure(figsize = (8, 5))
sns.countplot(data = ufc, x = "title_bout", palette = "viridis")
plt.title("title vs non-title fights")
plt.xlabel("distribution of title vs non-title fights")
plt.ylabel("number of fights")
plt.show()
```

```{python}
#champ_counts = ufc.query("") filter
#champ_counts = ufc["R_fighter"].value_counts()
#champ_counts_b = ufc["B_fighter"].value_counts()
#print(champ_counts, champ_counts_b)
#set_a = set(ufc["R_fighter"])
#set_b = set(ufc["B_fighter"])
#total_fights = set_a.intersection(set_b)
#print(total_fights)
```
