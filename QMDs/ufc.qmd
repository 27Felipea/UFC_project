This dataset contains information on UFC fights that had a champion participating. This dataset is 4 years old so what I would like to do is create a model, perhaps a simple one, that will be used to predict championship title matches that have happened since and upcoming bouts. To challenge myself further I wil try to make **USEFUL** vizualizations and will be using python to throughout this project including using new packages such as matplotlib, seaborn and plotly (I have minimial experience with pandas).

First lets load in these packages and our [UFC dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akouaorsot/ufc-champions-fights/data) from kaggle and take a look at some of the first rows of the dataset

```{python}
import os
import pandas as pd
base_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath("__file__"))
data_path = os.path.join(base_dir, "..", "data", "ufc_champs_final.csv")
ufc = pd.read_csv(data_path)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly.express as px
print(ufc.head())
```

As we can see there are a 121 variables so we need to consider whether there are variables that are unnecessary for our purposes such as significant strikes as we are going to use our model to try and predict future title bouts and until the bout is over we do not know these quantites. First lets take a look at the counts of NAs in each variable in descending order, this is implemented in the following code chunk:

```{python}
na_counts = ufc.isna().sum().sort_values(ascending=False)
print(na_counts)
```

As we can see there are numerous variables that have considerable missing data especially these columns defining one of the fighters respective rank during the dates of the bouts which makes sense as each fighter that is not a champion at the time of the respective bout will only have 1 rank in 1 weight class (out of 12). Notice we have a weightclass column so can we collapse the ranks into 1 column that gives their rank and we already would know their weightclass from the weightclass column. Luckily I just noticed there is a column that already does this so we can drop 24 variables, but if there was no column that did this we would be able to use python's version of pivot longer with the melt function collapsing the columns into one after filtering them with some form of regular expression. 

```{python}
#ufc_subset_drop = ufc.filter(regex="_rank")
#ufc_subset_drop = ufc_subset_drop.drop(columns = ["B_match_weightclass_rank", "R_match_weightclass_rank", "B_Pound-for-Pound_rank", "better_rank", "R_Pound-for-Pound_rank"]) 
#ufc_subset_keep = [f for f in ufc if f not in ufc_subset_drop]
# With the code above we have a subset that has selected the 24 columns of interest

#ufc_subset = ufc.melt(id_vars = ufc_subset_keep,
#                    value_cars = ufc_subset_keep,
#                    var_name = "weight_class_rank",
#                    value_name = "rank")
```

The code above is an implementation of using the melt function for the purpose stated above. Instead we can just drop the 24 variables as shown in the following code chunk.

```{python}

```

Something worth contemplating is whether we only want to take into consideration championship bouts lets take a look at the distribution of championship vs nonchampionship bouts:
```{python}
sns.set_theme(style = "whitegrid")
plt.figure(figsize = (8, 5))
sns.countplot(data = ufc, x = "title_bout", palette = "viridis")
plt.title("non-title vs title fights")
plt.xlabel("distribution of non-title vs title fights")
plt.ylabel("number of fights")
plt.show()
```
